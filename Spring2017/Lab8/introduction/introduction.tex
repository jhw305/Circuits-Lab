A D-latch, a common component in digital logic used for storing bits for fast access later, is designed using a $90$\si{\nano\meter} CMOS technology.
The circuit is first prototyped at a transistor level and tested in a SPICE simulator.
Once its behavior in this higher-level simulation is verified, the layout is designed in a layout editor.
The circuit is then simulated in the layout editor for more realistic information on its performance after fabrication.
