The 2SC5736 npn BJT is provided with four different bias conditions from which to choose: $V_{CE} = 1$\si{\volt} and $I_{C} = 5$\si{\milli\ampere}, $V_{CE} = 1$\si{\volt} and $I_{C} = 7$\si{\milli\ampere}, $V_{CE} = 1$\si{\volt} and $I_{C} = 20$\si{\milli\ampere}, and $V_{CE} = 2$\si{\volt} and $I_{C} = 5$\si{\milli\ampere}.
The noise figure must be below $1.8$\si{\dB}.
Therefore, any bias condition whose minimum noise figure is above this level cannot be used.
In the frequency range from $1.8$\si{\giga\hertz} to $2.0$\si{\giga\hertz}, the third bias condition has unacceptably high noise figures (well above $2.1$\si{\dB}).
The second bias condition has an acceptable noise figure until about $1.9$\si{\giga\hertz} when it exceeds $1.81$\si{\dB}.
Other components and networks will only make the noise figure worse, so this condition is also unacceptable.
Both the first and fourth bias conditions are to be analyzed, and the device is to be selected based on the best tradeoffs between available gain and noise figure.
