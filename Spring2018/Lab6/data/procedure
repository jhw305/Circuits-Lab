1) Current source
	- Test the transistor. (X) Then connect the resistor. (X)
	- Just the diode connected transistor with the resistance box in series (X)
	- Tune resistor so that current is 225uA (X)
		- Current is at 213uA.
		- 10k for Rref
	- Add extra two transistors for current source (X)
		- 480uA total current
	- Set Vd on those transistors to be high enough so they're in saturation. Ensure total current is 450uA. (X)
2) Common source amplifier 1
	- Build a voltage divider and test
		- 5ks for both transistors
	- Bias with the voltage divider 
	- Build two common source amplifiers with M1A and M1B
		- 10k and 5k in parallel for the drain resistors. Get about 3.0V bias at the output.
	- Then add one current source beneath it. Check the characteristic. Should look like CSA with src degen
3) Common source amplifier 2
	- Do the same thing, but bias so the same operating point as CSA 1
4) Connect the two together
	- 240uA through one side
	- 246uA through the other
