/subsection{Clamping & Distortion}
The output voltage swing of V_{in+}, V_{in-}, and of V_{in+} - V_{in-} is overall consistent with the simulated differential amplifier.
When one transistor is near cutoff, the other is near triode, and vice-versa so that the differential mode output is large.
The value of the differential mode output swing is near the expected value of V_{DD} - V_{t}, which when divided by A_{DM} is consistent with the maximum input amplitude that we found to incur only slight distortion.
