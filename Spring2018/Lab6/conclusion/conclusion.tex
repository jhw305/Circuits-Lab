\subsection{Differential-Mode \& Common-mode Gain}
The differential amplifier produced results that are clear and easily measurable.
However, the differential-mode gain of the amplifier is observed to be a whole order of magnitude lower than the results from simulation.
This may be partly due to high frequency attentuation since the circuit is operating at a relatively fast $1$\si{\mega\hertz} frequency. 
When the frequency of $v_{in}$ is changed to $1$\si{\kilo\hertz}, the output amplitudes increase.

Also, it is observed that transistors M1A and M1B have a slight mismatch as $V_{out+}$ and $V_{out-}$ vary by $60$\si{\milli\volt} and the drain currents on each side of the differential amplifier vary by $6$\si{\micro\ampere}.
Other inconsistancies may be due to slight variations in resistor values as well.
Overall, the differential amplifier exhibited behavior within the realm of expectation. \\



\subsection{Clamping \& Distortion}
The output voltage swing of $V_{in+}$, $V_{in-}$, and of $V_{in+} - V_{in-}$ is overall consistent with the simulated differential amplifier.
When one transistor is near cutoff, the other is near triode, and vice-versa so that the differential mode output is large.
The value of the differential mode output swing is near the expected value of $V_{DD} - V_{t}$, which when divided by $A_{dm}$ is consistent with the maximum input amplitude that we found to incur only slight distortion.
