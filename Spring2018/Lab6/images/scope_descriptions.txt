All voltages listed are interpreted as peak-to-peak
source 4 = Vout-
source 3 = Vout+
scope_0 = Vin-, 200mV
scope_1 = Vout+, Vout- for 200mV input
scope_2 = Vout+, Vout-, VDM for 200mV input
scope_3 = scope_2 but for 1V input
scope_4 = scope_2 but for 2V input (clamping)
scope_5 = scope_2 but for 200mV input and at 1MHz
scope_6 = scope_5 but for 1.5V input
scope_7 = measurement of max/min voltages of Vout-
scope_8 = measurement of max/min voltages of Vout+
