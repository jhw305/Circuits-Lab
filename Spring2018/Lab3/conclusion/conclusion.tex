The common-drain amplifier exhibits a "voltage follower" behavior.
The small-signal output voltage of the amplifier simply tracks the small-signal input voltage of the amplifier.
The common-source amplifier is to be used a voltage amplifier.
By increasing the bias voltage past the midpoint, a higher gain can be achieved.
However, this is at the cost of output voltage swing.
For the same series resistor, the common-drain amplifier has a much lower output resistance than the common-source amplifier.
Thus, by cascading a common-source amplifier as the voltage amplification stage followed by a common-drain amplifier that follows its voltage, a higher gain can be achieved for a given load simply because the output resistance drops considerably.
