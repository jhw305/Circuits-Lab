p- and n-channel transistors are characterized using Cadence Virtuoso. The $I_{D}$ versus $V_{GS}$ and $I_{D}$ versus $V_{DS}$ curves of the n-channel MOSFET are analyzed. Then the $I_{S}$ versus $V_{SG}$ and $I_{S}$ versus $V_{SD}$ curves of the p-channel MOSFET are analyzed. Other properties such as body leakage current are considered.
