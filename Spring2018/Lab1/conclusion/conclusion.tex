The $g_{m}$ values for all of the simulations are quite close (within 5\%) of the value provided by Virtuoso's DC operating point analysis. $g_{ds}$ is generally quite accurate as well. However, for the NMOS at $V_{GS} = 5$\si{\volt}, the simulation result from the graph is off from the DC operating point analysis by over 30\%. The reasons for this are not quite clear, though it may be that Virtuoso's definition of $g_{ds}$ in the triode region differs from $\frac{\partial I_{D}}{\partial V_{DS}}$. A deeper investigation is required to understand this discrepancy. Furthermore, the simulation model captures the leakage current through the body of the MOSFET and can thus be considered quite accurate compared to real transistors. Lastly, the calculated $\lambda$ values are close to, but not exactly equal to, the $\lambda$ value in the simulation model. The equations used for channel-length modulation are likely a first-order approximation, and Virtuoso may be using a higher-order model that considers $\lambda ^2$ or even $\lambda ^3$ terms.
