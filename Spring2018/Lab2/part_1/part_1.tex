$V_{GS}$ is swept from $0$ \si{\volt} to $5$ \si{\volt} in increments of $0.2$ \si{\volt} and the voltage drop across a $10$ \si{\ohm} resistor connected to the drain is measured at each point. 
The drain current $i_D$ is then calculated for each point using Ohm's law.
The results are plotted and tabulated below.

When a gate voltage $V_{GS}$ is applied to the NMOS, an electric field is generated across the metal gate and p-type substrate. 
This electric field repels majority holes from the surface of the substrate, creating a depletion region. 
The NMOS operates in cutoff region for $V_{GS}$ between $0$ \si{\volt} to about $1.5$ \si{\volt}. \\

When $V_{GS}$ exceeds $1.5$ \si{\volt}, donor electrons move to the surface of the substrate to form an n-type channel between the drain and source of the NMOS. 
This voltage is the threshold voltage $V_{tn}$. 
At this point, the NMOS is operating in saturation region because the saturation condition, $V_{DS} > V_{GS} - V_{tn}$ is met.
This is clear, as $V_{DS} = V_D - V_S = V_{DD} - 0 = 5$ \si{\volt} and $V_{GS}$ never exceeds $5$ \si{\volt}.
In saturation mode, the drain current is observed to quadratically increase as the gate voltage increases.
This is consistant with the drain current equation for NMOS in saturation, $i_D = \frac{1}{2}k_n' \frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{tn})^2$. \\

Then, $V_{SB}$ is set to $0.5$ \si{\volt} so a negative voltage is applied to the bulk of the NMOS, and the experiment is repeated.
The results are plotted and tabulated below. \\

The negative voltage applied to the bulk of the NMOS causes the depletion region between the heavily doped n-type drain/source and the p-type substrate to widen. 
The wider depletion region impedes the formation of the n-type channel and the gate voltage must be increased to compensate.
This effectively increases the threshold voltage of the NMOS.
This also agrees with the Shichman-Hodges model for the body effect of MOSFETs, $V_{tn} = V_{to} + \gamma(\sqrt{2\phi_f + V_{SB}} - \sqrt{2\phi_f})$ where $V_{to}$ is the threshold voltage when no voltage is applied to the body, $\gamma$ is the body effect parameter and $\phi_f$ is the bulk potential of the MOSFET.
In this experiment, the threshold voltage $V_{tn}$ increased from $1.5$ \si{\volt} to about $1.9$ \si{\volt}.

Refer to Part 3 for $\frac{W}{L}$ ratio of the NMOS.
