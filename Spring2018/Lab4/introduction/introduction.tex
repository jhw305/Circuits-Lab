\subsection{Introduction}
In this lab, the common-source and common-drain amplifiers using the CD4007 MOSFET package as an NMOS are analyzed.
Each amplifier's VTC and small-signal gain is determined, and the effects of the gain under a small load resistance are investigated.
In particular, how cascading the two configurations can produce a larger gain on a small load is investigated.
