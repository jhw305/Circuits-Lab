\subsection{Introduction}
In this lab we analyze the common-source and common-drain amplifiers using the CD4007 MOSFET package as an NMOS.
Each amplifier's VTC and small-signal gain is determined, and the effects of the gain under a small load resistance is investigated.
In particular, we investigate how cascading the two configurations can produce a larger gain on a small load.
