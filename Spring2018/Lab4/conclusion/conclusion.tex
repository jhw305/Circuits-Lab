\subsection{Part 1}
The common-drain configuration behaves as expected in both DC and AC tests. The circuit's near-unity gain makes it an excellent voltage follower if operated upon at the right frequency.
There was a noticable decrease in gain at higher frequencies due to the unavoidable parasitic capacitance in the package, as well as other frequency effects.
\subsection{Part 3}
Decoupling capacitors should be used in practice for amplifier designs to prevent the output signal from having a DC bias that may affect later circuit stages.
When a load resistance is added to the output, the gain is going to drop significantly due to the formation of a voltage divider with the amplifier's output resistance.
One way to remedy this with common-source amplifiers is to add a common-drain amplifier stage to its output because common-drain amplifiers typically have lower output resistances.
The data and oscilloscope plots confirm these claims.
